3.Qustions:
Que-1 Which Problem is your project solving?
Ans- Our Project is going to solve the problem of students,employees and others. Who came in theTier 1 or Tier 2 cities like Ahmedabad,Gandhinagar For Education or for Work. So they find many difficulties finding PGs,Hostels and Good Homemade food. So Our project is going to solve all this Problem By making a website which solves all this problem and they get all this option in One website. 

This problem is important to address because when they cannot get good living or food facilities, it is also harmful for their health due to bad food quality. And By giving good living space to people their work power is also increased.

Que-2 What are existing similar solutions?
ans - In this market there are already many existing players like Mykhanna,Zolo living,Stanza Living,Homefoodie,Studentcosy. But in these websites they serve different purposes like Mykhanna and Home Foodie only serves the Homemade food to customers they do not serve living options.While Zolo living and Studentcosy only serves living options to the customers. There is only one app Stanza living which fulfils both Purposes but they cannot give home food to their customers.

All competitors have similar strengths in that they have a good consumer base and good network to sellers and they have a good PGs network.
